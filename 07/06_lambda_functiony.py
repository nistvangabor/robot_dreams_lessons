# lambda arguments: expression
# A lambda function to add two numbers
add = lambda x, y: x + y

# Using the lambda function
result = add(3, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 8

#Simplicity and Conciseness: Use lambda functions when you need a simple function for a
#  short period and donâ€™t want to formally define a full function. They are especially
#  useful in situations where the function is used only once or twice.
